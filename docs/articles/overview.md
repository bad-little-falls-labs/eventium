# Eventium Overview

Eventium is a modern, extensible event-driven simulation engine supporting discrete and continuous time models.

## Key Components

- Simulation Engine: orchestrates scheduling and event execution.
- Event Queue: priority queue ordered by time and priority.
- World & Entities: entity-component model for simulation state.
- Systems: plug-in handlers for event types.

See `DEVOPS_ROADMAP.md` and the root `README.md` for development workflows and usage.
